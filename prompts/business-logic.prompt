Generate the JavaScript business logic for a calculator application with the following requirements:

Core Functionality:
- Support for basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Proper handling of the order of operations (PEMDAS)
- Ability to chain multiple operations
- Decimal number support with proper precision handling

User Interaction:
- Real-time display updates as numbers and operations are entered
- Clear button (C) resets the calculator to initial state
- Support for negating numbers (Â± button)
- Keyboard input support matching the button interface

Error Handling:
- Graceful handling of division by zero (display "Error")
- Prevention of multiple decimal points in a single number
- Maximum digit limitation to prevent display overflow
- Clear error states when new calculations begin

Edge Cases:
- Proper handling of operations on the result of previous calculations
- Correct behavior when pressing equals multiple times
- Handling leading zeros and decimal points appropriately
- Preventing multiple operators entered consecutively

The code should be well-structured, maintainable, and thoroughly commented to explain the logic.
