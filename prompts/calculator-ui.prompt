Generate a HTML5 calculator interface with:
- Display screen at top showing current input and result
- Grid layout with 4 columns
- Number buttons 0-9
- Operation buttons: +, -, ×, ÷
- Additional buttons: . (decimal), =, C (clear), ± (negate)
- ARIA accessibility labels
- Semantic HTML structure
- Mobile responsive design with clean, modern styling
- Button hover and active states for better user feedback
- Support for keyboard input (numbers, operators, Enter for equals)

The calculator should have a professional appearance with:
- Soft shadows for depth
- Clear typography
- Consistent spacing
- Color scheme that's easy on the eyes (light theme with dark text)

The HTML should be structured for clarity and maintainability.
